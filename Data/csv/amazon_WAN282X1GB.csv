 I purchased this 8kg silver inox washing machine to match my Haier silver inox fridge freezer. It's nice and quiet and the Speed Perfect setting halves the time of the setting you choose. Make sure you remove and keep the four bolts from washer to ensure a smooth wash. The spin is a pleasure to the ears as my other machine was rocking and rolling. I've also noticed that the wash results are better and the items even look cleaner. I paid for it to be installed unfortunately there was a leak but I noticed it in time for the guys to come back and rectify error a couple of hours later. It's only been a day but so far so good, I am very pleased! If the performance changes u will update this review.. I have noticed that after a wash cycle there is a puddle of water left in the seal so I'm having to remove it to avoid any future mold."
1,2023-04-17,4,Short hoses,Machine is good but water inlet hose and drain hose are both short. I have another standard appliance sitting between the washing machine and the sink where the fresh water pipe and waste pipe are located. I could not connect the washing machine with the hoses that came with the machine and had to order a separate kit with 2 longer hoses from Bosch. £48 and 3-5 working days delivery.
2,2023-04-17,5,that it was as good as my previous bosh washing machine and it is,brill
3,2023-01-22,4,Would recommend buying this.,"This is the most expensive washing machine I’ve owned and can honestly say that it’s the first one that looks like the clothes have came out really clean, even on a short cycle.  My favourite modes are the short ones and I like the fact that you can stop the machine and add any forgotten garments. When you do stop the machine when it’s in action, there is a symbol which tells you if you are able to open the door or not. This saves wasting time wondering if the door will open to add to the wash."
4,2023-03-30,5,Excellent Product.,"Very good Machine ,price is excellent & very easy to install. would definitely recommend to others."
5,2023-01-27,4,Remove Transit Bolts,I read a few of the low rating reviews.They mention that the machine jumps around when on a spin cycle.I presume that they didn't read the owners manual to know about removing the 4 transit bolts at the rear of the machine.Only getting 4 stars though as I feel the quality isn't as good as they used to be.
6,2023-03-26,3,Transport Bolts Transport bolts transport bolts,YOU HAVE TO REMOVE FOUR VERY TIGHT and CERY LONG BOLTS FROM THE BACK OF THE MACHINE BEFORE YOU CAN USE IT!!!!There is a sticker that tells you this but if it wasn’t for reading through the reviews I probably wouldn’t have noticed it! The bolts screw into the tub to stop it moving around and the Suspension being damaged during transit. So if you have just installed it and its Going Brock wild then this is why!!!Stay safe kids :-)
7,2023-01-20,5,reasonably priced,"My old washer I had to retire or should I say it stopped working on Tuesday,  after 13yrs of faithful service I now have an all singing and dancing new Bosch washer arrived today Friday it looks good easy to use though I have only used it a couple of times does as its told and more it even has a night time setting! well worth the money and for a few more pounds they will install and take away your old one and the packaging well impressed with the service from this company thankyou for your speed of delivery and the delivery people were very courteous and considerate x"
8,2023-03-25,5,Bosch washing machine,Fair price easy to use alot quieter than old machine
9,2023-03-12,5,Highly Recommended,My wife has sight loss. We needed a machine that was reliable and easy to use. This machine fits the bill perfectly!
10,2021-05-29,3,Not Quite As Good As I Hoped,"I love Bosch kitchen products. Our last Washing Machine lasted over 13 years, was used virtually every day and never required an engineer visit or a replacement part.This latest machine is good but it does not excel. It washes well, is incredibly quiet, appears to be well built and still inspires confidence.However:1. The quick wash 15/30 min has a very short max spin speed of 1200 rpm and it's pretty useless.  The washing is not as dry as I would like. Certainly nowhere near as dry as the older Bosch I had. So I either have to spin again at 1400 rpm or select to have the wash only with the 'no drain & spin' option and then when that cycle ends, select the drain and spin option separately at 1400. This increases a 15 minute quick wash time to around 30 mins at least. This is a huge disappointment as the one main benefit of having Bosch over others is their famous 'quick wash' option, which is no longer suitable and certainly a 'downgrade' in performance from previous models. I'm not sure it's the spin speed at fault or rather the length it spins for, which is incredibly short.2. The wash time is ridiculously long. You can shorten most times with 'speed perfect' for smaller loads but for a full load of cotton bedding 3 hours is ludicrous. If like me you prefer to line dry, half the day is gone before you can even put the washing out.3. Bosch has reduced the packaging that the machine is delivered in. A good thing?! well yes and no. I like the fact that it doesn't come in a massive box, it's delivered wrapped in polythene with polystyrene on all 4 corners but there is no protection at all around the door, which protrudes quite a way. So this makes damage to this part especially, highly likely. So even though it's shrouded in polythene, mine arrived with slight damage to the door. I received discount to keep it but even so it's another disappointment because I am forever looking at the very visible front scratches. Personally I would rather have a cardboard box that can be easily recycled than copious amounts of polythene that offer no real protections at all.I expect all the above, spin speed, wash time and packaging are due to the endlessly changing EU regulations on being overly ECO. I just can't see how increasing wash times which in turn increases energy consumption, reducing drying performance which again means extra energy is needed and reduced packaging which will lead to more returns due to damage, increasing C02 pollution in the transport process, are of much benefit to the overall cause.It would be great if the computerised section of these machines could have a firmware update to correct the flaws, which are all down to program software. As it is, this isn’t possible, so I’m left feeling slightly disappointed, which for me is a new experience with regard a Bosch product. I do feel that perhaps I should’ve spent more time researching other brands, as maybe this time I was duped by my brand loyalty."
11,2022-12-03,4,Does what it should and it does it quietly.,It's a few months now since I bought this washer. It uses far less water than my previous washer but does the job perfectly well. Runs very quietly. I'm very happy with the results.
12,2022-04-11,4,"Quiet, efficient but slower","My 13 year old Bosch washing machine finally died.It had been perfectly reliable up to that point so I stuck with Bosch for its replacement.On arrival it was noticable how much lighter it was compared to the old one.Plumbing it in was simple as it had the same connections.After half a dozen or so loads I can say that it's much quieter than my old machine.The programmes take much longer like for like though.  I presume it's for eco reasons but its the reason I've taken a star off.I often have to shut the door a couple of times and press it in further until it will lock.Clothes have been coming out nicely cleaned but no drier than with my old machine even though the spin speed is now faster.Judging by my smart meter, energy consumption has dropped by quite a bit. Very handy in current times with such high energy bills.It sounds like I'm not too happy with this but its just that my old machine was so good, hence I stuck with Bosch.Hopefully it last as long!I hope you find my review helpful."
13,2023-02-19,5,Quiet and get the job done well,The series 4 was valuable for small budget. Overall performance was excellent and quiet. It has multiple washing features for different clothes or materials. I highly recommend it for 2 or 3 people family.
14,2022-12-09,4,Needs to be more economic to run.,Used for small and medium sized loads - cleans clothes very well
15,2022-06-23,4,A couple of annoying things…,"Two issues with this.1. You cannot preset a spin/rinse once the wash is finished. Once it has run the wash cycle you have to manually switch it to the spin/rinse mode and set it off again.2. The beeping. Once it’s finished a cycle it seems to beep on for ages, not two-three times but six-eight. Ok we get it. And no way to modify this other than switching it off.It’s a washing machine and it works and it does what it is supposed to do, but there is a lot of competition. I had a Samsung for 10 years prior and these small things are just annoying enough to make me regret changing brands."
16,2022-07-15,4,Good machine. Lacks mid length wash cycles,"I struggle to select a programme suitable for some of my needs with this machine. It's great for long, economical cycles, great for very short wash cycles, great for specific cycles like wool or lingerie, but when you've got a mixed load of synthetics, eg school clothes, the available mixed programme is only 59 mins long and not long enough to get a large load clean.It's a very quiet machine however.3 of the cycles: cottons, colours and eco are exceptionally long, well over 3 hours, eg the colours cycle is 4:24, eco is 3:35 & cottons is 3:28 - which is far too long. I find the long cycles really wear out all but the toughest clothes."
17,2022-09-18,4,Still very happy after 6 months,Works great and has everything you need in an 8kg washer. Very happy customer and the Amazon delivery team fitted it for us and took off one away. Recommended.
18,2022-12-09,3,Leak under sink via new washing machine,The machine is greatHowever Amazon sent a chap round to install the machine which i paid extra for the man didn't do a good job as he left me with a leak under my sink i had to get a plumber
19,2021-06-14,4,Quiet & effective but some lengthy cycles,"This is a very quiet machine in operation.  It has quite a wide range of cycles but it is advisable to study the program parameters if you like to adjust things for yourself, because options are not as wide as you might think from the advertisements.  This model has the higher spin speed of 1400 rpm BUT this is only available in certain programs, as are the temperature variations & the maximum loads.  Yes, this can prevent unintended results but it obviates personal needs & preferences.  Some cycles seem ridiculously long for their purpose:  the standard cottons program taking 3 hours.  The manual does NOT give program times or even ranges, which is a rather a sly move on the part of Bosch. One rather irritating, if minor,  point is the inability of the window seal to drain completely, leaving about a tablespoon of water sitting in the bottom.  Bosch warn users to dry this &, for long life of the seal, that will be essential."
20,2022-11-13,5,Another Quality product from Bosch,"SO pleased with this machine, good capacity, not the cheapest, but quality costs.The machine is so quiet in operation I have found myself having to check that it has started.  v. quiet during the cycle and during the spin."
21,2021-08-06,4,Happy so far,"I'm quite happy with this washing machine.At first I panicked with how technical it is but it's quite easy to figure out.Good bits:Looks nice and very quiet spin.Clothes smell cleaner than with my old beko.Not so good bits:The spin cycle, even on the highest spin, I'm finding I'm having to do an extra spin as the clothes are still quite wet.The washer beeps quite loudly once it's finished a cycle 3 loud beeps, then another 3 loud beeps, then another 3 loud beeps. I thought this would annoy me too much but I'm used to it now so it's fine.If you stand too close to the electric panel, it pauses the cycle but again that's more annoying than bad.I haven't tried all the different cycles yet as most of them are quite long but overall I'm happy with it so far."
22,2022-11-17,5,Great machine very good service and installation,"The machine is easy to use, has very good cycle options and is quiet.  It is efficient and worth every penny!  Highly recommend this product ."
23,2022-12-01,5,"IT'S A BOSCH, says it all","used it a lot in the last 3 weeks,  everything comes out clean & bright"
24,2022-12-20,5,Great machine,Great machine
25,2022-11-24,5,Very quiet running.,"Need to read the instruction manual fully, it then became more easy to organise the wash programme."
26,2022-09-07,5,This was the week...,"... when my faithful old Bosch gave up the ghost - just after I'd bought a new fridge freezer (also Bosch). Not the Bosch's fault, a supposed engineer replaced the door seal which resulted in a flooded kitchen.So we decided to replace rather than repair - it runs quietly and economically, very pleased."
27,2022-11-22,5,looks good,"replaced an older model, this has bigger load and more efficient on power."
28,2022-11-16,5,"Bosch, German quality.","Bosch, great machines. Large capacity and does the job well"
29,2022-10-28,5,Quiet and good quality,Machine seems solidly built and is much quieter than our previous BoschCan’t review wash performance as only just started using it
30,2021-10-22,5,Beware of the installation,"I like this machine. It's really quite, easy to use, but obviously it is really, really hard to install. I paid £40 for the installation and in six months my wonderful new machine quit working.I cleaned the filter. I cleaned it again. And again. Because my machine said it's E-36.Today I had unplugged the drainage pipe construction, and here is what it looks like (see the pictures)Obviously, I got to learn the science of properly installing these machines by myself. I am a good school and college teacher, I enjoy gardening, I can do so many things with my hands. I really expected those Bosch guys being able to do their job so, that I shouldn't be needed to do it all over again after them.All and all I do recommend the machine itself, but don't trust the installation."
31,2022-05-19,4,A lot of long washes.,This only has one short wash a mixed wash and the start touch pad some times doesn’t work just beeps and beeps. A lot to get use to but it looks nice and stylish.
32,2022-10-28,5,good looking machine,cant say to much just had it installed from my last washing machine hostpoint aquarius aaa
33,2022-03-14,5,Which program?,"Relatively easy to use but we have to keep checking the manual and search through the programs for the best Cycle, you have to press the temperature and spin buttons to check that it is correct for the clothes in the drum, we wish that these indications were automatically displayed when the program is selected without having to check them individually. Some programs only spin up to 800 and heat up to 30*. we tend to use the 1400 @ 40* most of the time due to workwear. We'll get used to it eventually."
34,2022-06-24,5,Few features but outstanding results,"If your first priority is outstanding cleaning results and you don’t need a machine which has dozens of pointless programs, or the ability to be able to add an odd sock during a wash cycle rather than simply waiting for the next wash, or to be able to communicate with it remotely using the internet, then you’ll be really happy with this machine. The cleaning results are truly amazing!"
35,2022-10-18,5,Excellent value for the money,Great washing machine that does the job quietly and effectively. So easy to use would recommend to anyone.
36,2022-11-13,5,Excellent purchase,Excellent
37,2022-05-18,5,Brilliant!,"I’ve only just received this product and used it a few times but even on the quick wash the stains are removed, the clothes smell fresh and clean and it’s very easy to use. And it is sooooo quiet!! I had a Hotpoint previously which was very noisy in comparison.Also the duo who delivered and installed it were fabulous! They went above and beyond and were very kind and helpful!"
38,2021-11-24,5,Might go for a bigger drum,We had a 8kg drum similar Bosch machine which packed up after about 10 years use which for a large household and daily use was quiet good. So went for Bosch again to a slightly bigger drum. In retrospect might have gone for a even bigger drum but I think this it is a hard one to decide and perfectly happy witht he 9kg size. It has delivered to my expectation as most Bosch products do. It is a bit more quieter. I have made sure it is levelled correctly  which I am sure help the component last longer. Have also have a sound absorbing matt underneath. Great product at a competitive price point
39,2022-10-26,5,Brilliant washing machine loads of programmes,How silent it was worth paying that extra few pounds
40,2021-01-21,5,Great Machine,"Was a bit put off by reviews saying it had long complicated cycles, but have found it very straight forward to use and it washes very nicely. You can shorten most cycles using 'speed perfect'- and in the quick wash this reduces it from 30 to 15 mins (but this does then require a spin which adds another 13 mins) and this  reduces the size of the load to 2kgs- but perfect for a quick turn around for a few items. A mixed load cycle completed in 59mins, compared to the 3+hours for some other cycles. The only issue I have had so far is when putting a Childs coat in a quick wash followed by a spin- it couldn't balance the weight so didn't spin properly- but I threw in a few clean towels to balance it and it worked fine! A great machine, and happy customer."
41,2022-03-10,4,Very quiet in operation,"Quiet when in operation.Wash quality no better or worse than previous machine, regardless of literature on the subject.Easy to use and program.Articles not as dry as hoped after spin program."
42,2022-02-18,5,One of the best Washing machines seen so far,"Absolutely love this beauty. Perhaps this is because our old machine had started making loud noises and appeared to fall below our expectations. With this beauty, I feel tempted to use it again and again. It is unbelievable to see that a washing machine be that ""quiet"" and still performs exceptionally well. Needless to say that I am super impressed with Amazon when they delivered the new, installed it, and also recycled the old one at the lowest possible cost. Thank you so much, guys."
43,2022-07-03,5,Value for money very reliable and easy to use,It was so easy to install I’m in my seventy’s and female after watching a  u tube video I managed to install it myself with a little help from my son-in-lawI really recommend Bosch they are value for money well made and very reliable I had my last Bosch washer 14yrs
44,2022-03-25,5,A quiet and efficient washing machine,"We are vey pleased with this machine that works notedly more quietly and runs more energy efficiently than the machine on which we until very recently relied.  Significantly  the machine enables us, through a nuanced means of programming, to take a fuller view of the environmental issues than before. It makes laundry more convenient, less costly and more environmentally friendly. It represent a desirable combination of technological advance and environmental consideration."
45,2021-10-01,4,Efficient and oh so quiet!,"The programmes are a puzzle as you can't seem to change the temperature or duration. One for example says 40 to 60 degrees so which is it? We tend to use 1 hour at 40 a lot, changes to 46 mins when you press ""speed perfect"" if it's not full. Washing comes out clean, almost dry. Best feature is the quiet motor, you can hardly hear it working!"
46,2022-10-18,1,It wouldn't even switch on.,"Once I'd connected everything up and tried to switch it on, nothing other than a brief flashing display happened.  Fortunately, Amazon were quick to refund and remove it.This machine appears to have a big display with touch sensitive buttons.  No proper on/off switch.I think the computer system is at fault.  I'm a big fan of Bosch power tools, but I think they've put a rubbish chip in this machine.Of note for future purchasers of washing machines...1 - Ensure you personally drain the old washing machine if you want Amazon to remove the old one.  Just pressing the ""drain"" setting on the machine will not fully drain it - remove the water filter and drain it yourself.  The deliverymen refused to take away the old machine because there was still water in it.2 - Ensure the delivery guys actually install it if you've paid for them to do that.  I forgot to insist they did it, then unpacked and installed it myself.  Then I found out it was faulty.  This all took some time, and then more time before it was picked up by Amazon.  And removing the tubing from the waste pipe of my home took more time."
47,2022-05-25,5,Brilliant,It's a great machine. Very quiet and douse what it says on the tin. Our last machine was also a Bosch and lasted 19 years. To be fair the old machine was still going but the noise it was making indicated its demise was imminent.  Only had it a few weeks but very pleased with it.
48,2022-01-29,4,Good value washing machine,"This Bosch is the third one we've had, whilst the programmes are all very good, the robustness of the build is not as good as the older model we'd had for quite a number of years."
49,2022-05-14,5,Quiet,I ordered this machine as a replacement for an older Bosch which was beyond repair.The controls are clear and easy to use. There is an option to add an extra rinse into the sequence which saves adding it later. Some programmes can have the temperature changed. The machine is quiet during wash and spin .
50,2022-03-15,4,Good product,"Good product, very quiet,the washing cycles are too long.The clothes need to be re-spun after the washing cycle has finished."
51,2022-02-27,5,Washes well and very quiet,I don’t really know how easy it was to install as I paid for installation by the delivery crew. There’s a hell of a lot of washing programs and parameters but I tend to just use the cotton one and switch between 40 degree or 60 degree washes. The wash is very good. The machine is very quiet in operation - both wash and spin cycles. There is virtually no vibration.
52,2021-06-03,5,Just Great,Forced to buy a new one after a power cut blew ours up!I am a bloke but have taken over the domestic chores.I can’t believe I am reviewing a washing machine but it is bloody excellent!I would sound like a TV ad if I could explain why but it really is just very good.The controls are clear and after 10minutes of reading the instructions I was able to master them and take control of my washing. I use a lot less washing liquid and the results are better than my previous 3 yr old Bosch.EDIT 1 YEAR LATER:Still a fantastic machine but please read the load weight maximums for each setting.Occasional poor wash caused by overloading the machine for a particular setting.Most embarrassed to have this pointed out by my “told you so” wife!
53,2022-03-31,4,Good,It washes clothes which I what I wanted.
54,2022-10-10,5,Best Washer I have ever had in my 80years,Nothing to not like.
55,2022-01-22,5,The Delivery team were amazing! I can’t thank them enough.,"The team rang just before they arrived nice and early so I haven’t had to wait all day, they were very friendly and polite and nothing was too much trouble …our washing machine fitting is not the easiest. However they got on with it with no issues and checked everything was working before they left.  A dream.Thank you so much and such an easy process."
56,2021-01-26,5,Excellent machine that is good value,"We purchased this Bosch washing machine for my daughter and her new house and we are very happy with it.  We have always liked Bosch equipment as it is reasonably priced but the equipment is always very reliable in our experience.It's reasonably quite, washes and spins clothes well and looks as good as any other 'white washing machine'.The option to be able to pause the wash to put any missed items in is very good.The normal cycles can be pretty long (2.5 - 3hours!) but there is a 'Quick' option which can reduce this dramatically (40-45 minutes for some programmes) - although it supposedly uses more energy (not sure how a 45minute program uses more than a 3hour...).Well recommended."
57,2021-03-09,4,Poor Installation Service,"Great washing machine however the installation costing £40 was extremely poor. The feet weren't adjusted leaving the machine wobbling about. Then heard loud banging noises during the first run. Pulled the machine out and found the travel bolt plastic sleeves had been left in, these were banging against the drum internally causing the noise. Hopefully no long lasting damage to the machine! My partner warned me about buying this on Amazon as she was concerned the installation wouldn't be done properly and she was right."
58,2020-12-16,5,"Machine great, but delivered with a damaged top","Wonderfully quiet machine which delivers a superb wash. Things are coming out cleaner than ever. Only downside is that the cycles are very long - the eco cycle is over 3 hours!Not an easy item to return due to bulk and weight but very disappointed that the top was dented and scratched to the extent that the metal was exposed. Hope it doesn't rust as a result. The top had been covered in cardboard but something very heavy and sharp must have been dropped on it. Not discovered until the delivery men had left and we removed the carboard packaging on the top of the machine. Suggest polystyrene (eco variety) instead of cardboard for future reference. Considering the long wait for its delivery, the damage is very disappointing"
59,2021-11-25,5,Great washing machine,The most impressive part of this is that you can cut down the wash time by half with the Speed Perfect button and that it's very serious when it comes to spinning. The clothes come out really quite dry before you hang them to dry.. so that's a good start to completing the task! I kind of wish I'd bought the 8kg but the 7kg should be enough to cope with just the two of us.
60,2022-06-09,5,Great machine,"Love machine.I wash nearly everything on 45min wash. Some wash cycles go on forever!Warning - if you decide to purchase the Bosch extended warranty, you Only have 30days from purchase to do this!"
61,2021-02-18,5,5 star,"Works well, the most silent machine I have ever used. Not all the program cleans well, but I have found the most suitable for me. Only problem was with it, at the time of purchase, the site didn't let me choose the installation option, as when I clicked on it, the page didn't let me go further, didn't matter what date I choosed. Actually this site problem saved me 40 £, as my friend came and installed it for free, hence I didn't take out any star. I recommend the product and the seller, and there was no problem with the delivery, which we have a lot in this area."
62,2022-07-02,5,Being able set finish time is a great feature,"Very quiet operation and like ability to change temperature settings in individual programmes. Hope it lasts as long as the last Bosch machine, 16 years plus."
63,2022-09-06,5,Best Purchase,Good value for money
64,2021-07-03,5,Super quiet,"Love this! Did some research into quiet appliances. This IS! I can hardly hear it at times. When spinning, it’s quieter than my dishwasher. The control panel is a bit too touch sensitive if you lean on it, or brush past it with clothes that make contact, but other than that I’m impressed. At first glance, when selecting some wash programs they appear excessively long, but if you select Speed Perfect function, then most of them halve in time. The 30 C quick wash is quick at 30 minutes and covers most day to day washing."
65,2021-08-19,5,All round good washing machine,"pleased from the start. love that you can stop it and open to add a forgotten item. the tub is larger than our older model, making it easier for bedding. a good range of dial options for different clothes, as well as the option to change the temperature setting. I do feel the economy is not always practical as it suspends the washing; alright if not in a hurry. as it stands, i am happy with the item, even though it does not have half load."
66,2022-04-29,5,Bosch Quality,Very good machine and a quality build.Quiet in operation  even on max spin speed.Amazon offered the chance best price and good installation team.I would use Amazon again for future white goods.
67,2021-10-07,4,Very quiet.,This machine delivered as advertised.The machine was was very easy to installThis machine has a very quiet spin cycle and loads of different wash cycle.
68,2021-08-24,5,Good Value Washing Machine,"Great machine - fairly quiet compared to our last machine.Easy to understand programmes - I personally only use one or two so this machine fits the bill. Has a useful 15 or 30 minute quick wash and you can adjust things like spin speed, temperature etc. For each programme.All in all, I am pleased with my purchase up to now and if it lasts as long as my previous machine (11 years) I shall be very happy."
69,2021-02-10,4,Good,So far really pleased with machine. It’s lovely and quiet when in use which was really important living in a flat with an open kitchen.Works as you would expect. The only minor thing I would change if I could was to make the door a bit bigger as it’s quite small in comparison to my last machine. But only a very minor issue......
70,2022-02-12,5,Great machine,Works brilliantly but front panel display looks like something from the 90s.  Having said that loads of white goods manufacturers put screens on their appliances that are laughable in their resolution.  Surely it wouldn’t cost much to make it look like a early iPhone
71,2022-03-31,3,Spin Cycle,"Does the washing. Plenty of different washes, but the spin cycle..... the machine nearly takes off. It bangs against the sides and moves out across the floor."
72,2022-05-18,5,good product,The product is very good but the courier is no experience to install the machine even I have paid the installation fee :(
73,2021-06-17,5,This machine washes very well whites are noticeably white! (Shame on my old machine),I have had this machine for one month now and at first I was quite dismayed at the length of some of the programmes-  so I have tried them all and have found that the ( much) shorter programmes work just as well as The (very) long ones so I am content and now have my favourites!I am astounded at how quiet the machine is and delighted with how well it actually washes all my whites are now white.
74,2022-06-18,5,Great washer,Plenty of programs including a 15 or 30 minute wash. Quiet working. Great results.
75,2021-12-05,5,Learn your programs,"When we first got the machine, my wife was quite disappointed because all the programs she looked at were quite long ones, but after a bit of fiddling and practice she now has found quick wash program for about a hour, she is now very happy and the machine is performing very well to expectations."
76,2022-04-14,3,How it works,"Small scratch on right hand side 70mm long, no manual with it , old people like one ."
77,2021-07-05,5,what a great washing machine,never had a bosch washer before but read lots of reviews from different websites. have to admit im loving it. its so quiet and does a real good job with my clothes its pleasure to do the washing nowthe delivery men were so polite and unwrapped for me and took all the rubbish away asked if i was ok getting it fixed in place. they were a credit to amazon
78,2022-06-18,5,Dishwashing machine is very good and very easy to use,I don’t dislike anything for this machine it’s just a job
79,2022-04-24,5,It's a Bosch this is my 3rd bosch washing machine in 21 years its the Rolls Royce,Plumb it in read instructions after a week throw the instructions away no need to look at them ever again. Enough said
80,2022-07-11,5,Just works,Washing
81,2021-09-03,5,Washing machine,Great machine. Not that easy to install. Came with an extremely short hose. My plumber had 2 attempts at popping out to get an outlet pipe long enough to reach the drainage outlet pipe. Had I paid for installation with amazon they would not have been able to install it and it would have been money wasted. Can't fault the machine itself though.
82,2022-05-02,5,Easy to use,"Delivery was fast and very helpful , went above and beyond . Excellent value for money  ."
83,2021-04-09,3,Touch screen and spinner let this great washer down,Great washer. Not that quiet. After 3 months  touchscreen already playing up and spin is so sensitive that it regularly fails to spin. Annoying as previous 19 y/o Bosch span the same items without any issues at all. Will call the engineer as soon as faults are constant. Till then it will just drive me mad.....if I call them out now ... I know from the unclucky law of experience... that it will behave and walk away..... saying it’s fine and I’ll have wasted a day waiting for them to show up.
84,2021-07-22,4,Machine Good instructions to complicated,The thing that lets the machine down is that the instruction book is far to complicated to follow needs simplifying for ease of use.
85,2022-05-28,5,Good machine,Brilliant machine washes well and very quite even during spinning cycles.
86,2021-06-01,5,very quiet operation.,"remember when washings used to shake and rattle and start walking across the room during the pin cycle?This Bosch washing is so quite I need to check its still working during the wash, Its a solidly built unit that does not go walking.This is the best washing machine I have had so far and the 9kg drum means I can even wash my large duvets.Great machine."
87,2021-11-27,5,So quiet,"Best washing machine I’ve had in years, I love that it indicates the wash weight. Great anti bacterial wash, bedding and towels.Great value for moneyOld machine taken awayNo hassleIf I have to buy again will still buy this one"
88,2022-02-04,5,It's of high quality,This is the second Bosch washing machine we've had and it comes fully up to our expectations with the added bonus that it's easy to program.
89,2021-05-20,4,Good product and service,Very happy with my new machine and especially with the delivery installation and removal of the old machine all for an extra £40 . Well worth it .
90,2021-09-02,4,Fine,"Value for money, very important in this day & age."
91,2021-03-21,4,Great Washing machine,Great washing machine  easy to use. Jus be careful leaning against it when reaching into your wall units as the touch control can resest to wash.
92,2022-03-22,5,Eco friendly and economical.,I had my last bosch 17 years and wouldn't have anything else.
93,2020-09-03,4,Terribe service from Amazon,"Product was fine, communication from Amazon was dismal, delivery took nearly three weeks and only then once I made a tremendous fuss, appalling service from Amazon. I am disappointed by the lack of customer care and information, very poor."
94,2021-05-18,4,Very quick to wash and gets it clean!,A VERY sensitive control panel - if you lean on it/knock it/ child touches it then the cleaning starts all over again!
95,2021-08-05,4,"washing times were shorter than I expected, but the machine is very effective",MY WASHING CAME OUT AS CLEAN AS EXPECTED
96,2022-12-06,1,"No worth of the money, this washing machine has health and safety issues","The media could not be loaded.
                



 No worth of the money, no safe to use, during the spin cicle this machine start to shake and jumping as a normal washing machine should do.  i request a full refund plus compensation for the damages caused"
97,2022-01-20,5,Handsome,"We referred to the youtube installation clip and installed it ourselves, very easy.It works very well and very quiet when spinning."
98,2020-12-17,5,"Don't expect recycling, installing and testing even if boxes are ticked.",The product is as expected as it was to replace an old bosch washing machine. It was the sales pitch that was poor. Promised to remove old machine and install and test new machine (£40 extra to be charged after providing service) not a problem. However delivery guys don't install or remove old machines apparently. So I think it was a sneaky way of selling their product.
99,2021-03-20,5,Sooo quiet!,"The first time we used this we thought it was faulty. It is so quiet that the water intake is louder than the machine itsself! The only time you can hear it is when it starts to spin, and even at full belt, it is nothing to worry about. Superb washing and great value for money."
100,2022-02-03,5,Excellent washing results on all settings!,"Easy to use, extremely quiet during cycle, good looking , the best washing machine I ever had!"
101,2021-08-30,4,Recommended model,It was recommended
102,2021-07-09,5,Great Washing Machine,"This is an excellent machine. my wife says.  ""Best washing machine I have every had"".. Very versatile, adjustable spin in any programme, 4 Kg. mixed 59 min wash exellent, very quiet, able to stop and add items after starting the wash. Cannot praise it enough."
103,2021-08-23,4,Good quality,Good quality
104,2021-08-20,5,Bisch Basch Bosch,Have been using this for over a month now and it is an excellent washing machine with lots of useful features. Very quiet when washing or on spin cycle. Built to usual Bosch standards and washing results are brilliant. Would thoroughly recommend.
105,2021-01-02,5,Works perfectly,The W/M was delivered wihtin 4 days of placing the order and given a time slot of delivery on the day. Dlivery personel unpacked the  item and made sure was in good visable condition. They took away all the packaging  The W/M works as expected and plumbing in to an existing system was very easy
106,2021-04-21,4,Doesn’t use enough water,Quiet machine. Doesn’t use enough water for large loads  . But will spin without moving and quietly.
107,2021-12-29,2,Had a faulty one,"Firstly a positive, did a good job on washing clothes. However this unit vibrated terribly and made a horrible clanging sound on spin. Was bought as ""acceptable"" from amazon warehouse so expected the cosmetic damage but quite easy to see how it was caused when machine shaking violently. Return and refund processed really smoothly, just glad I kept the packaging. I am sure most are fine but sometimes there is a reason why it was a customer return in the first place."
108,2021-02-28,5,BEST Washer Ever!!,The BEST Washer i have ever owned runs a treat so easy to use and quiet sometimes have to check its still washing! A great all rounder digital controls and nice flush door so keeps nice and clean the best from BOSCH delighted hope to get many years from this great Washer!
109,2022-03-01,5,Quiet machine,Delivery by Arrow was poor but washer is great
110,2021-05-01,5,Fast reliable service- very quiet machine,Wouldn’t normally think of Amazon for a washing machine but quickly delivered and fitted and old one taken away for recycling. Competitive prices and reliable professional service. The Bosh machine is effective and yes is very quiet compared to other washing machines. 5 stars fully recommend
111,2022-01-17,5,A great brand,I’m be always trusted Bosch products and I am so happy with my washing machine.
112,2021-07-18,3,Rubbish feet,One of the feet broke off when sliding it back into position. Cheap nasty plastic feet. Why not a quality metal bolt type foot that won’t break off. The appliance cost enough to warrant a decent set of feet!!
113,2021-01-05,4,Easy to use,"Used for washing clothes, very pleased with the programmes & the timings, adjusted how I use the programmes to suit my laundry."
114,2021-04-03,4,Check it before delivery guys leave,"Arrived and working ok, but when unpacked there was a small dent on the door"
115,2021-09-27,2,Item  cannot be installed,"Washer item shown as ""GB"" model but Hotwater connection cannot be effected to current fitting under sink.Washer connectioon appears to be for non british use. BOSCH MACHINE. It appears that a modified or adaptor fitting is required. I have had to contact plumber to come and survey/repair the washer to obtain working situation {Tuesday). I would require AMAZON to cover additional cost which I will advise you when notified by plumber. I took this matter up with AMAZON. Your rep advised ME to contact BOSCH for a solution. This problem is YOUR responsibility to rectify. Please advise."
116,2021-08-11,5,New washing machine,Turned up on time /day stated  old machine taken away along with the packaging from the new one . Up and running within the hour great machine good price can’t fault it but time will tell

121,2021-03-31,3,Quality of service,Not the cheapestBut the delivery time quoted was the bestBut was delivered a day lateThe delivery people were friendlyBut we're not wearing masksI'd just spent two weeks in hospital with covidAs for the machine works okBut early days

125,2021-07-29,5,Great machine,This is maybe not the most sleek looking washing machine but it does deliver performance exactly as described. It is very quiet and cleans clothes. Can't ask any more in my eyes. I would highly recommend.
126,2021-12-16,5,Very good washer,"Quiet and as described very good machine wife very happy with it, and that's what matters,"
127,2022-11-02,1,Not working. And no one turning up to return item!!,"Love this machine, however it is not draining or spinning (and hasn’t since I received it) and I have been waiting for 2 weeks for it to be picked up to get it returned for a refund. I keep getting put through to people who don’t understand me …… and I am really frustrated now"
128,2021-12-07,5,Really nice washing machine for the price,Was presently surprised at how nice this washing machine looks and performs. Very quiet even during spin cycle.
129,2021-10-24,5,Has lots of eco features & washes well,Replacing our old Bosch washing machine with this one. Does a good job and much quieter than the old one. Plenty of great features.
130,2020-12-12,5,Great low price Bosch Washing Machine.,Another excellent washing machine from Bosch. Bought it to replace one 19 years old and still in working order. Hope this performs as well! One small moan is the difficulty in lining up the mark on the control knob with the programme being selected unless looking straight on at eye level.
131,2021-07-25,5,Very pleased,Great machine . Easy to use. Fits in loads of washing as it’s a bigger drum than my last machine. Quiet . Love the drum clean function as I’m a hygiene freak!

139,2021-03-31,4,Good value,Easy to use
140,2022-10-28,1,Disappointing,Had this machine for 4 months and today for the second time am getting an error code which Bosch tell me doesn’t exist! E36 … 10. So have another engineer visit booked. I expected more from a machine that cost me this much 😩
141,2020-12-31,2,Disappointing: Slow & Limited,"Pro: Runs quietlyCon: Cold fill only, so uses expensive electricity (rather than cheaper gas) to heat water- Supplied without an ""elbow"" to guide the waste hose into a standard UK waste pipe- Instruction manual is very poor & hard to understand- Very limited range of washing programs, far fewer than my 40-year old machine, so it may lack the programs you want- Very slow: Most programs take over three hours- Does not seem to wash clothes effectively- Its design means that it projects into my kitchen, rather than fitting under the worktop"
142,2020-09-25,4,It does the business!,Just being used a as regular washing machine. Spin cycle is particularly good.
143,2021-07-29,5,Efficient and quiet.,Simple to use and great wash. Great value for money. Checked review on Which online before I bought - Best Buy. So far nothing to dislike!

150,2021-05-08,5,Tasty!,"Not sure why they ask us to rate flavour but washing machine is silent, reliable and so much better than any of the cheaper models we have had before."
151,2020-12-12,5,Wahing Machine,This machine is great. However I have yet to get used to the longer time to complete the cycle. This is probably due to the cold fill while my older machine was hot and cold fill. Very happy overall.

157,2022-04-11,1,Broke down after less than a year!,Extremely disappointed with this washing machine and with Bosch in general. The machine is stuck closed for about 3 days now and it is not able to drain water (there is NO emergency drainage hose as in some other models - cost saving?)The closest repair date that Bosch could provide is around 11 days after the machine broke. I've called to see if this could be moved forward and no earlier dates were given.I'm stuck with a broken washing machine and my clothes will rot inside during the next 10 days.AVOID THIS PURCHASE!
158,2021-11-25,5,Great,Usual great Bosch design & quality

230,2021-10-09,2,Nice Looking BUT!!!!,"Each part of wash program has to be set individual after each cycle, wash then wait then drain and spin. Time wasting. Thought more of Bosch but disappointed."

246,2021-03-27,5,Great washer,Great washer
247,2022-03-01,1,Disappointing purchase,Although the max. spin is supposed to be 1400rpm every time I do a wash the clothes are still fairly wet and have to be re-spun. Well below my expectations of a Bosch productI would not recommend this washing machine
248,2021-09-13,1,"There is a problem at slow spin revolutions, horrendous banging coming from drum.","I need help with my faulty Bosch please, horrendous banging sound coming from drum whenever on low speed spin. Noise disappears once the drum starts spinning quickly. Not sure if this is relevant but if I spin the empty drum it sticks and won't spin freely.Please help!Kind RegardsSteve Rowley"
249,2020-07-23,5,Good washer,"Cleans well, quiet, like the timer."
250,2023-01-16,5,"Quiet, efficient spin andeffective short wash","I'm a single household but use my machine regularly. I've had the machine for 18 months and it has worked well to date. I like the bigger 9kg drum as it allows for bigger loads and I can wash all my bedding, including a mattress protector, which is quite bulky."
251,2021-12-03,1,Incompetent installer,The product only arrived today and the person tasked with installing didn’t do it correctly and caused structural damage to the house very disappointed
252,2021-07-19,1,Scratches on front and leaked.,First use- water flooded from control panel.  Returned item for refund. Amusing conversation with chat help who suggested I use something to patch the leak from the electrical control panel.
253,2021-07-03,1,Don’t Buy,"The media could not be loaded.
                



 It’s terrible the whole house is shaking  ."
254,2021-01-18,1,Defective washing machine,The washing machine has a fault.
255,2020-07-15,5,Wonderful washing machine,"This is my first Bosch washing machine. I've tried most of the other major brands over the years, so having had both a Bosch oven and fridge freezer and been happy with them, I decided to purchase this washing machine.The most noticeable thing is how quiet this Bosch washing machine is. Personally, the noise coming from a washing machine doesn't bother me at all, but for some I know this is an issue and I've never owned a quieter machine than this one. Whatever the spin speed, it doesn't seem to get noticeably louder or violently shake as some washing machines are prone to do. There are not as many different pre-programmed washing cycles as you get with some other washing machines and some of them can take three hours to complete. You can choose shorter ones for small loads and there is a 'Speed Perfect' option to reduce the washing cycle duration. I'm not really ever in a hurry for my washing to be done very quickly, and given that the washing machine has good energy efficiency ratings waiting for the cycle to be finished isn't the worst thing in the world. I'm sure that the increased length of cycle is deliberate to improve the overall efficiency.The two things that really matter to me with washing machines are how well they clean the clothes (without damaging anything) and how long they last without becoming prone to needing to be repaired or replaced. I'm very happy with how this Bosch washing machine washes clothes and bed linen but can't really comment on its longevity after only having it for a few weeks. I shall update this review if it breaks prematurely, but as it stands I am very happy with this washing machine and would recommend it."
256,2022-02-25,5,The replacement for a what’s the piont !,"This machine replaced a what’s the piont, there is no comparison ! Superb Bosch, yes a lil’bit more expensive ! but a Series amount Better Quality, this really is an Excellent product ,well built , Easy to use, efficient , and so dam quite u think it’s not working ! hahaha Very Happy Fish, Very Happy Wife, Well Worth every penny of the extra outlay, Plus, a Which Guide best Buy . Real quality !"
257,2021-09-26,1,Hate hate hate,"Absolutely hate it, yes it’s quiet and that’s it it’s 1400 spin is only on a couple of programs so you have to change it if you don’t want soaking clothes. It’s so sensitive it often stops working, the child lock is infuriating no just spin only rinse spin that we have to constantly use because it’s not spun, often just bleeps because it’s decided too much weight with only a couple of items in, this then overrides rinse spin because it says it’s too heavy with the wet clothes it hasn’t spun, I hate it so much we are buying a different one but I feel too bad to sell this to someone I don’t hate, it also likes to clog up if you use a colour catcher and then doesn’t drain, I could write a book on how awful this washer is don’t understand why  people think it’s good I honestly can’t understand the point of a 1400 spin that doesn’t spin at 1400 and it also takes ages to wash and if you want it quickly guess what yes it knocks spin speed down so you have wet clothes so then it’s rinse and spin absolutely pointless as that to be overridden from 1200. The amount of times I have to wash things again makes it totally non economic or eco friendly doesn’t like to use soap or softener if in drawer either leaves half behind. Had to move it to a different room because if you walk past it it stops. Hat it."
258,2021-11-13,1,Wash machine not washing well,I have the Serial 2 and am disappointed with the quality of washing
259,2022-05-27,5,Bosch WAN28281GB Serie 4 Freestanding Washing Machine with AllergyPlus and SpeedPerfect,"We've only had this machine for a short time and haven't used it much. We like the ability to be able to alter the spin speed, temperature and to be able to reduce the wash cycle by about 50% by using the Speed Perfect wash cycle. Our last Bosch washing machine only lasted 6 years, let's hope this lastt a bit longer!!"
260,2022-07-15,5,Fantastic,"Wow I am so pleased with this washing machine, I have a few in my time but this one knocks spots off of them all apart from my first one which was a Bendix and I loved that too, it lasted 15 years was used every day too! This machine is so much quieter than all of them so don’t hesitate buy one you won’t be sorry."
261,2021-07-31,5,Great machine,Love Bosch always had one. This is quiet and the drum is big 9kg. Allows you to change run times. Perfect
262,2021-09-23,5,So quiet.,"Best machine ever at least so far! The delivery team were brilliant, massive thank you to the team from Inverness."
263,2022-05-22,5,Bosch washing machine,It's nice and quiet. excellent
264,2022-05-19,5,Quality,Good
265,2021-10-27,5,"its Bosch, doesn't need a review","very impressive , vey less sound , its in one of our WC near to my bedroom , no sound no nose to bedroom . I love this."
266,2022-09-17,5,Perfectly Silent,"Quality Machine, hopefully this will last many years"
267,2021-05-28,5,Great machine,"Big tub but not too deep, plenty of choice of programmes, very functional, almost matches my 3 year old serie 8 drier, pity the door does not have a chrome surround. this on is silvered plastic."
268,2021-07-18,5,"Excellent washing machine ,works like a dream and quiet too .",Easy to install very reasonable priceand came very quickly .
269,2021-07-19,5,Brilliant Washing Machine.,"It's been 16 years since Iast bought a new washing machine. Old faithful gave up the ghost.Had a really good look around because it seems we're spoilt for choice now?I found this on Amazon, and looked at all the reviews. I was hooked and had to have it.Took less than a week to arrive, plumbed it in myself which was really easy.Love all the programmes and settings, super quiet. My sister and brother inlooked at it, they had bought a new machine last year and it's done nothing but broke downit's a very Hot Point with them at the moment (wink wink nod nod)They wanted one and commented how whisper quiet it is!Had it going over the weekend and it's just performed brilliantly.If you want an excellent make and washing machine buy Bosch!"
270,2022-10-10,5,Ideal replacement,"Quickly delivered and installed by the crew who brought it.  They worked efficiently and tidily making sure there were no leaks.  Basic instructions given.  A good replacement for my old 15 year machine by Bosch, very quiet and probably easy to use once I read the handbook. Recommend having it installed with removal of old machine...a worthwhile experience."
271,2021-02-20,5,Good quality,"Good quality, worth buying."
272,2021-01-04,5,Very quiet.,This has to be the quietest washer I have ever heard.
273,2023-01-04,5,1 year latter & all's well.,I bought the basic Bosch - works well & faily quiet.  I just want a reliable machine that does a good job - so far this machine has lived up to the challenge.  Gets regular use.
274,2022-07-25,5,Reliable and a decent wash,Always buy Bosch so reliable and a good washing machine
275,2022-02-24,5,Washing machine,This is a replacement for a Miehlie and is as good
276,2021-09-10,5,You can rely on a Bosch,"I've had several different brand washing machines in recent years and although they wash OK, aren't up to this machine at all. Been using it for a couple of months now and I'm very pleased.Positive features:LOTS of useful and customisable washing programsWashes extremely well - even using PODS, you get a proper wash with lots of foaming. Gives you the confidence that your clothes are getting cleanGood size drum and takes a big weighted loadGood spin speed - clothes don't come out wringing wetInstant open after wash end - no delay before the lock is releasedEasy to useNegatives:Easy to accidentally brush against the control panel which is very sensitive so you can find yourself pausing the wash etc.The door doesn't have a ""clip"" type opener - i.e. pull that to open the clasp. Instead you just have to pull on the door. It required a bit more force than I initially thought (on my machine) so I was a bit nervous that I might break it. It's been fine though (so far)The door trim has a plastic finish and isn't stainless steel. Not a biggy but a shame because it would have looked to be the quality that it is if it had.The door itself isn't glass but a plastic. Unfortunately, my dogs claws scratched the front in the first week!In summary, I don't think you can beat the washing and features of this machine for the price but if you're able, take a look at a more expensive model for a better door."
277,2021-05-25,5,Great machine,Love the machine.I got with it the installation and removal and found the whole thing worth the money.
278,2022-01-27,5,This product is easy to use and quite.,"Nothing to dislike about. I use this product for all types of household laundry, including winter heavy curtains."
279,2022-02-22,5,The small print!,"Unfortunately the removal of the old, and the install of the new did not happen. The words for doing the same should not have been attached to the offer. Amazon agreed to pay my fees for doing the same, but I am still waiting. The machine is ok for two people and does the job, well which did the recommending"
280,2021-09-03,5,Awesome washer,"Sounds sad, but I cannot believe how good this is. So quiet I have to check it is running.Have been really impressed with how well it washes. Seems quite eco friendly with energy it is on about 12 times at least a week.To say I’m impressed is a short call."
281,2022-11-12,5,more expensive than some but worth it,excellent in all ways
282,2022-08-30,5,A good buy,Used this washing machine over the last week and I am delighted with the it's performance.
283,2023-04-01,5,Great washing machine!,Absolutely love this washing machine! Good balance between size and cost for our family. Good quality and stylish
284,2022-11-05,5,Very good and the delivery persons could not have been more helpful.,Good value easy to use and delivery great
285,2022-03-03,5,ok,ok
286,2022-02-10,5,Love my new washer,"Was a bit overwhelmed at first as it seemed very complicated. The manual isn't very good as it is not laid out in a logical way. For example, the manual says you have run the machine empty before using but it doesn't take you through the process so I just ran a short cycle. Only later did I come across that it was supposed to be the drum cleaning cycle.I ended up watching a few YouTube videos to get the information I needed.I like the iDos system although it is using a lot of laundry liquid. I've reduced the dosage but still using more than I usually would.The machine is so quiet, you don't notice it's on."
287,2022-01-22,5,Amazing,"I’ve had lots of washers in my time but this is amazing.the best I’ve ever brought it’s so quiet,would recommend this to anyone"
288,2022-01-08,5,Nice big drum,Like this!Lots of programmes although some take over 3 hours which I doubt I’ll use often. A good drum size which is important for a family. Spins clothes well. Quiet doesn’t make too much noise at all and has a countdown timer so you know when it’ll be finishedExcellent delivery with text updates - highly recommend those guys
289,2022-09-06,4,Check connections before installers leave,The washing machine is fine but installers left me with leaks at the connections to the sink waste pipe which soaked the cupboard and washing powder and which I did not find till I did the first wash. Not good enough!
290,2021-06-15,5,Great,"Very happy, next day delivery, much quieter than my old one, easy to install"
291,2022-12-15,5,Does everything well,Good robust machine from Bosch
292,2021-11-02,5,value for money,its working perfectly well as far as I see it
293,2021-04-17,5,No,Good
294,2021-11-18,5,Working great,"Canny machine ,short wash times not to much noise on spins.,,sticks out at the front a bit but looks good..HAPPY"
295,2021-02-28,5,So quiet!,"Upgraded from my 5 year old Bosch and glad I did. Awesome washing machine, I do find the eco mode is long but it’s super economical and the clothes come out amazingly clean.Definitely recommend."
296,2021-06-26,5,"So, so quiet","I had to look to make sure the washing machine was working as it was so quiet. The clothes are perfectly washed and in a reasonable lenth of time. I would like to add the delivery persons did an excelent job, as I requested placed in the room I wanted having taken away the packaging. Most polite and efficient."
297,2021-02-16,5,Good washer,Does the job A+++
298,2021-10-13,4,IT LOOKS GREAT BUT NO INSTALLATION PROVIDED,"It seems to be as advertised, but what was very disappointing is that there was no installation included, and  no option available neighter to pay for it. So I had to call a plumber a pay other money on top of £350 so this washing machine costed me over £400.The item is new , but cannot tell if is working well. I wilk have to wait for the plumber to install it. They should add an optional installation to make life easier to single women like me."
299,2021-03-01,5,For the price very good,Nice wash machine very quiet  Very happy with it
